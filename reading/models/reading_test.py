    Each reading test contains multiple passages, each passage contains multiple question types,

    - Unique test identifier for easy reference
    - Organization-based data isolation for multi-tenant support
    - Source tracking for test origin (Cambridge, Custom, etc.)
    - Timestamp tracking for creation and updates
    - Hierarchical relationship with passages
    - UUID-based primary key for security and scalability
